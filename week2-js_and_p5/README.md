## Week 2 - Class Intro, Terminal & Github Review

###### January 30, 2017

**GIT AND GITHUB**
- Reminder: the process to get a local repo connected to a remote is:
	- Set up a repo on github.com, then ```git clone``` it to the location you want your local to be in.
	- Or, ```git init``` a local directory to initialize it as a git repo, then ```git add remote origin <your remote repo link>``` to connect it.
	- Three steps to remember to commit and push your changes to remote:
		-	```git add <your file, or . for all in your current directory>```
		- ```git commit -m "<your commit message>"```
		- ```git push origin master```
- If you're still having trouble getting git/github started and understanding what is going on try [http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1/](http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1/) and [http://readwrite.com/2013/10/02/github-for-beginners-part-2/](http://readwrite.com/2013/10/02/github-for-beginners-part-2/)

**GITHUB.IO PAGES FOR HOMEWORK**
- Set up your github.io page. You can use any general structure you like but just make sure to have a page that will link to every one of your assignments.
- Github pages guide: [here](https://pages.github.com/)

------

**GIT FOR WINDOWS USERS**
- Please follow [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/#platform-windows) to install Github Desktop in order to use Git Shell. Git Shell is installed along with Github Desktop and will take git terminal commands.
- Based on the 5 minutes I spent in class looking at Git Shell, it seemed to work fine especially when cloning a Repo to a local directory

------

**MARKDOWN**
- Markdown is a simple [markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language) that plays very nicely with Github. Github repos online will automatically render any file saved as README.md in the repo to serve as a user-facing text document with simple styling like headers, lists, images, and so on.
- [A good example of using a README.md in a github repo to give all sorts of information (scroll down)](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glslViewer)
