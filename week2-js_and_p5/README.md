**github**
- reminder: the process to get a local repo connected to a remote is:
	- set up a repo on github.com, then ```git clone``` it to the location you want your local to be in.
	- or, ```git init``` a local directory to initialize it as a git repo, then ```git add remote origin <your remote repo link>``` to connect it.
	- three steps to remember:
		1-	```git add <your file, or . for all in your current directory>```
		2- ```git commit -m "<your commit message>"```
		3- ```git push origin master```
